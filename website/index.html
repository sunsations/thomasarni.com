<h1>Blogging</h1>
<p>about software and the web.</p>
</header>
<div class="cols">
<p>One of the greatest ways on how remote people can interact and
exchange ideas with each other is blogging. Never in human history, has it
been easier to get in contact with like-minded people in the world.</p>
<p>This is a chance I don't want to miss out, because I'm an avid
reader of various blogs and learned a lot of it. For java enthusiast
like me there are great blogs like <a
  href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/">Java Code Geeks</a> or <a
  href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/">Resources for Java
developers by IBM developerWorks</a> and many more.</p>
<p>A full list of Java and software engineering related blogs I
read, can be found in my <a
  href="https://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F18120724704320802436%2Fbundle%2FJava%20English">Google
Bundle</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite RSS feed readers are Google Reader and Byline on my
iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy your time on <a

  name="Sunsations Blog by Thomas Arni">my blog</a> and don't forget
"NEVER STOP LEARING"'!</strong></p>

<h1>Software Engineering</h1>
<p>and it's best practices.</p>
</header>
<div class="cols">
<p>I'm a Java software engineer with a strong information retrieval
background. Currently my main interest is on web development.</p>
<h3>Agile</h3>
<p>I believe that <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile
methodologies</a> (like <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum">Scrum</a>)
are currently the most effective way to develop great software. I hope
that more companies will start using Scrum and that the agile approach is
backed up by the management.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I am a strong believer that education at all levels
is one of the most important necessities for success. The truly educated
men never graduate. <a href="http://www.zuehlke.com/">Zühlke</a>, my
employer, offers four week per year for personal education. I simply
love this and hope more companies will follow in the future.</p>
<p>Especially in the software industry, where things used to change
so rapidly, it is crucial to keep up to date and learn new things.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>Books that every Java software engineer should have read (and
more importantly understood) are in my opinion: <a
  href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/ref=pd_sim_b_7">Effective
Java by Joshua Bloch</a>, <a
  href="http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315834566&amp;sr=8-1">Refactoring
by Martin Fowler</a>, <a
  href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=pd_sim_b_3">Clean
Code by Uncle Bob</a> or <a
  href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=pd_sim_b_1">Design
Patterns by Erich Gamma</a> to name a few. They represent compressed
knowledge of the masters in the field of software engineering.</p>
<h3>Principles</h3>
<p>To know the basic principles like <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>, <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29">SOLID</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedsia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Ain%27t_Gonna_Need_It">YAGNI</a>
is off pat.</p>
